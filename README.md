# PyTextArt
Print text in an ASCII art style

To use the script type `python pytextart.py "place your text here"`. That command will use the main font. If you'd like to use another font of your own type `python pytextart.py "text here" name_of_font`. Make sure that a python file with the same name is in the same directory.
