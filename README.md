# PyTextArt
PyTextArt is a simple python script specifically made to print text using ASCII art. Its semi-modular structure makes it easy to create new fonts.

To use the script simply type `python pytextart.py "place your text here"`.

## Advanced users
If you'd like to print the message more than once, type `python pytextart.py <count>`.

If you'd like to use another font, type `python pytextart.py <count> <font>`. Make sure you have a font file written in python in the same directory. (Don't add `.py` in the font name in the command as that is added automatically)
